                        <p>French colonial economic policies fundamentally restructured Vietnam's economy. Large-scale infrastructure projects, including railways connecting major cities and ports, facilitated the movement of goods and people. Rubber plantations in the south and coal mines in the north became centers of extraction, employing thousands of Vietnamese workers under harsh conditions. These economic transformations created new social classes and labor relationships while serving French imperial interests.</p>

                        <p>French colonial presence introduced new social dynamics that coexisted with and challenged traditional Vietnamese structures. Urban centers like Hanoi and Saigon grew as administrative and commercial hubs, attracting migrants from rural areas. A new working class emerged in factories, plantations, and mines, while an educated middle class developed through French education systems. Everyday life reflected this hybridity—traditional practices persisted alongside colonial institutions, creating spaces of both accommodation and resistance.</p>

                        <p>Resistance to French colonial rule was persistent and multifaceted. Early movements included traditionalist uprisings and intellectual critiques, but the interwar period saw the emergence of more organized resistance. The Indochinese Communist Party, founded in 1930, became a key force in organizing workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Strikes, protests, and underground organizing characterized the 1930s and early 1940s, culminating in the August Revolution of 1945 that declared Vietnamese independence.</p>
